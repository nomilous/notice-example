            # -----------------------------------------
            # 
            # ### Purpose
            # 
            # * Provides a dynamic caching space accessable to middleware at traveersal.cache
            # * The same cache instance is passed into ALL traversals
            # * Visible over the api, making it ultra useful an in integration vector
            # * DOES NOT PERSIST (restart the hub and it's gone...)
            # 
            # ### Possibilities
            # 
            # * A middleware can be placed early in the pipeline to persist it.
            # * How and to where is entirely up to the middleware.
            # * Guidelines
            # 
            #      * Remember, it should be global, retreiving from persistance per
            #        traversal.origin (which client is this capsule from) will lead
            #        to problems when attempting to view the cache from the api without
            #        a client context
            #      * Load origin specific stuff onto the capsule.origin object instead.
            #      * `cache.persistedComponent.lazyLoadedObject` sounds like a good idea,
            #        an Object.defineProperty() could probably configure the lasyload
            #        to get the record from some db.
            #      * This would be especially useful because of the fact that the API
            #        can drill into the cache. 
            #  
            #        ie.  /v1/hubs/1/cache/persistedComponent/lazyLoadedObject/someThingInIt
            # 
            #        (i ""think"" the mech that does the drilling will not disturb the neigh- 
            #           bours on the way down, if not, something will need to be ""done"")
            # 
            #      * Also in the works (for some unknown future release) is that ability to
            #        PUT/POST objects into the cache via the API, that obviously has sizeable
            #        implications for this persistor.
            # 
            #      * A last middleware could do the saving of any changes.
            #      * Or lazySave, if you know what i mean, this might be tricky
            #      * If anybody pulls this off i would love to see it / maybe incorperate it 
            #
