            #
            # API: curl -u user: :20002/v1/hubs/1/cache
            # -----------------------------------------
            # 
            # ### Purpose
            # 
            # * Provides a dynamic caching space accessable to middleware via traversal.cache
            # * Solves the problem of hotswapped middleware not having access to a surrounding scope
            # * The same cache instance is passed into ALL traversals
            # * Visible over the api, making it ultra useful as an integration vector
            # 
            # * DOES NOT PERSIST (restart the hub and it's gone...)
            # 
            # ### Possibilities
            # 
            #   * I made the following suggestion without considering the obvious diffiulty
            #     presented by the asynchronousity required for persisting. It cannot be 
            #     be done `as suggested`. 
            # 
            #   # * A middleware can be placed early in the pipeline to persist it.
            #   # * How and to where is entirely up to the middleware.
            #   # * Guidelines
            #   # 
            #   #      * Use the hub uuid.
            #   #      * Remember, it should be global, retreiving from persistance per
            #   #        traversal.origin (which client is this capsule from) will lead
            #   #        to problems when attempting to view the cache from the api without
            #   #        a client context
            #   #      * Load origin specific stuff onto the capsule.origin object instead.
            #   #      * `cache.  persistedComponents  .lazyLoadedObject` sounds like a good idea,
            #   #        an Object.defineProperty() could probably configure the lasyload
            #   #        to get the record from some db.
            #   #      * This would be especially useful because of the fact that the API
            #   #        can drill into the cache. 
            #   #  
            #   #        ie.  /v1/hubs/1/cache/persistedComponent/lazyLoadedObject/someThingInIt
            #   # 
            #   #        (i ""think"" the mech that does the drilling will not disturb the neigh- 
            #   #           bours on the way down, if not, something will need to be ""done"")
            #   # 
            #   #      * Also in the works (for some unknown future release) is the ability to
            #   #        PUT/POST objects into the cache via the API, that obviously has sizeable
            #   #        implications for this persistor.
            #   # 
            #   #      * A last middleware could do the saving of any changes.
            #   #      * Or lazySave, if you know what i mean, this might be tricky
            #   #      * If anybody pulls this off i would love to see it / maybe incorperate it 
            #   #  
            # 
            #   * The thing that does the drilling will require a ` way ` to recognize the lazy 
            #     persisted component and asynchronize accordingly. 
            # 
            #     https://github.com/nomilous/notice/blob/master/src/management/manager.coffee#L156
            #     or thereabouts ('/v1/hubs/:uuid:/cache/**/*')
            # 
            #   * I have suggested lazyloading because the cache could get quite big and the overhead
            #     when fetching it ahead of each capsule traversal would counter produce.
            # 
            #   * Also, now exceedingly pleased i did this waffling, it birthed me a steamingly fresh epiphany.
            # 
            #         * A `Noticeability` API
            #         * Examples below
            #         * Still in swaddling tho
